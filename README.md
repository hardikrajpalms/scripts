.ahk files use the older version of AutoHotKey to create shortcuts.
To have them running on startup:

1. right click on script, compile it.
2. create a shortcut and put it in the (Win+R, shell:startup) folder.

I may have committed personal data here. Have some decency.

Undocumented files are probably not working.
